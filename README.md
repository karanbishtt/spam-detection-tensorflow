# Spam Detection using TensorFlow

This project implements a **Spam Detection system** that classifies text messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **TensorFlow** and basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The project is developed as a learning-focused implementation to understand how text data can be preprocessed and used to train a neural network for binary text classification.

## 📌 Project Overview

Spam messages are a common problem in digital communication platforms. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically identify whether a message is spam or legitimate based on its textual content.

The complete machine learning workflow — from dataset loading and preprocessing to model training and prediction — is implemented inside a single Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains labeled text messages classified as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.

It is a widely used public dataset for spam classification tasks and consists of short text messages along with their corresponding labels.

The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources such as:  
- Kaggle – *SMS Spam Collection Dataset*

The dataset is used strictly for educational and learning purposes.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load and explore the text dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess the text data  
3. Convert text into numerical format using tokenization  
4. Build a neural network model using TensorFlow  
5. Train and evaluate the model  
6. Test predictions on sample text messages
